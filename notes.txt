BREACH 1 Credential Change on Password Recovery

Firstly, when inspecting i can see server is responding with .php file. So its a php server.
Looking at headers, requests are 
received by nginx/1.4.6 (Ubuntu) server and powered by PHP/5.5.9-1ubuntu4.29. 
Interesting header cookie: I_am_admin=68934a3e9455fa72420237eb05902327

i can login at:
http://10.13.200.178/?page=signin
I can recover password at:
http://10.13.200.178/?page=recover#

When inspecting page i get to see a hidden input with mail.
Submit returns a Invalid Form.
I make the input mail visible and change the text with smagniny@student.42madrid.com
Hit submmit and boom.
The flag is:
1D4855F7337C0C14B6F44946872C4EB33853F40B2D54393FBE94F49F1E19BBB0

I don't know why smagniny worked but changing credential worked.
However i know that there is a member with my student email. 
I go to member page at http://10.13.200.178/?page=member
When Searching member by ID smagniny i get: Unknown column 'smagniny' in 'where clause'

BREACH 2 SQL INJECTION

At http://10.13.200.178/?page=member
i can search a member with his Id on a search bar with submit button.

submit button calls GET to http://10.13.200.178/?page=member and with query id == input.
At html code We can see a hidden input with name="page" value="member".
And another one with name='id' and value='inputtextforIdsearch'
At submit url is: http://10.13.200.178/?page=member&id=inputtext&Submit=Submit#
output: 
    Unknown column 'inputtext' in 'where clause'

with id='as'
output:
    You have an error in your SQL syntax;
    check the manual that corresponds to your MariaDB server version
    for the right syntax to use near 'inputext' at line 1

So its using MariaDB and not sanitizing output since they are raw MariaDb exceptions.
So if i can put SQL syntax in id searchParam i can make an SQL injection.

id='SHOW TABLES;'
http://10.13.200.178/?page=member&id=%27SHOW%20TABLES%27&Submit=Submit#
output:
    You have an error in your SQL syntax; 
    check the manual that corresponds to your MariaDB server version 
    for the right syntax to use near 'SHOW TABLES' at line 1

I think MariaDB is translating query 'id' value into a SQL statement.
Exactly after the WHERE clause. So it must be doing some SELECT * FROM TABLES WHERE 'id-value-input'.
So if i find a condition that prints something i could be on the right track.
let's try with id=id>=0.
SELECT * FROM TABLES WHERE id >= 0.
Imaginando que la tabla tenga un id entero creciente para cada fila de la tabla.
output: 
    Unknown column 'id' in 'where clause' -> fuk

The SQL Statement is more like this then:
SELECT * FROM TABLES WHERE ID = 'id-value-input'.
So id=1 must output something
GET http://10.13.200.178/?page=member&id=1&Submit=Submit#
output:
    ID: 1 
    First name: one
    Surname : me

GET http://10.13.200.178/?page=member&id=5&Submit=Submit#
output:
    ID: 5 
    First name: Flag
    Surname : GetThe
